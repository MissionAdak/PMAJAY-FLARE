# PM-AJAY Three Dashboards Implementation Summary

## Smart India Hackathon 2024 - Problem Statement 25153

---

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive three-dashboard system for PM-AJAY agency mapping with authentication, interactive maps, and complete API integration.

## What Was Built

### 1. Backend Enhancements (Node.js + Express + SQLite)

#### New Database Schema
Created 7 new tables to support the requirements:
- **states**: Indian states/UTs with ISO codes
- **users**: JWT authentication with role-based access
- **projects**: PM-AJAY projects with geo-coordinates
- **fund_transactions**: Complete fund flow tracking
- **reports**: Document upload management
- **audit_logs**: System activity tracking
- Enhanced **agencies** table with state mapping

#### API Endpoints (16 new endpoints)
**Authentication:**
- `POST /api/v1/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/v1/auth/login` - JWT token generation

**Dashboards:**
- `GET /api/v1/dashboard/central` - Central govt KPIs with SLA tracking
- `GET /api/v1/dashboard/state/:stateId` - State-specific metrics
- `GET /api/v1/dashboard/public` - Public project data

**Projects:**
- `GET /api/v1/projects` - List with filters (state, component, status)
- `GET /api/v1/projects/:id` - Detailed view with transactions
- `POST /api/v1/projects/:id/progress` - Update progress (auth)
- `POST /api/v1/projects/:id/funds` - Fund transaction (auth)

**Master Data:**
- `GET /api/v1/states` - All states
- `GET /api/v1/agencies` - Agencies with filters

**Reports:**
- `POST /api/v1/reports` - File upload with metadata

#### Key Features Implemented
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based auth with bcrypt password hashing
- **SLA Breach Detection**: Automatic calculation based on project timelines
- **Fund Flow Tracking**: Three transaction types (allocated, released, utilized)
- **Audit Logging**: Complete activity trail for compliance
- **Role-Based Access**: Middleware for central, state, and public roles
- **File Upload**: Multer integration for report documents

### 2. Frontend Implementation (React 18 + Vite)

#### Three New Dashboards

**Central Government Dashboard** (`/dashboard/central`)
- KPI cards: Total projects, budget, utilization, SLA breaches
- State-wise project distribution bar chart
- Component-wise distribution pie chart
- Detailed state performance table
- CSV export functionality
- Real-time data from API

**State Government Dashboard** (`/dashboard/state`)
- State-specific KPI cards
- Project management table with inline actions
- Update progress modal (with progress bar input)
- Fund transaction modal (allocated/released/utilized)
- Report upload modal (file + notes)
- Action icons for quick access

**Public Dashboard** (`/dashboard/public`)
- Interactive Leaflet map with OpenStreetMap
- Real-time project markers with popups
- Search bar for filtering projects
- Component filter dropdown
- Project list view with cards
- Detailed project modal
- No authentication required

#### New Components Created
- `Login.jsx` - Authentication page with demo accounts
- `CentralDashboard.jsx` - Admin overview
- `StateDashboard.jsx` - State management interface
- `PublicDashboard.jsx` - Citizen information portal
- `AuthContext.jsx` - React context for authentication
- `api.js` - Centralized API utilities

#### Features Implemented
- **Interactive Maps**: Leaflet + OpenStreetMap (no API keys)
- **Authentication Flow**: JWT token management in localStorage
- **Role-Based Routing**: Redirect based on user role
- **Real-time Updates**: API integration with loading states
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first with Tailwind CSS
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth transitions
- **Charts**: Recharts for data visualization

### 3. Testing & Quality Assurance

#### Automated Tests
Created `backend/test-api.js` with 10 smoke tests:
1. Authentication (login)
2. States endpoint
3. Projects listing
4. Agencies listing
5. Central dashboard (authenticated)
6. State dashboard (authenticated)
7. Public dashboard
8. Project details
9. Progress update (authenticated)
10. Fund transaction (authenticated)

Run with: `cd backend && npm test`

#### Build Verification
- Frontend builds successfully without errors
- Bundle size: 968 KB (acceptable for feature-rich app)
- All dependencies properly installed
- No TypeScript errors

### 4. Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation:
- **README.md**: Complete setup guide with quick start
- **DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md**: Detailed deployment guide
- **IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md**: This file
- Inline code comments for complex logic
- API endpoint documentation with curl examples

---

## Errors Fixed

### 1. Merge Conflict in README
**Issue**: Git merge conflict from previous commits
**Fix**: Resolved by creating comprehensive new README with all features

### 2. React-Leaflet Version Incompatibility
**Issue**: React 18 incompatible with latest react-leaflet
**Fix**: Installed react-leaflet@4.2.1 with --legacy-peer-deps

### 3. Leaflet CSS Import
**Issue**: Map not rendering without CSS
**Fix**: Added Leaflet CSS import in index.css

### 4. Supabase Permission Issues
**Issue**: Database migration tools unavailable
**Solution**: Used SQLite as primary database (suitable for requirements)

## How to Test Each Acceptance Criterion

### AC1: Backend and Frontend Start Without Errors
```bash
npm start
```
✅ **Expected**: Both servers start on ports 5000 and 3000 without errors

### AC2: Central Dashboard Returns Aggregated JSON
```bash
# Get token first
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@pmajay.gov.in","password":"admin123"}' \
  | jq -r '.token')

# Test dashboard
curl http://localhost:5000/api/v1/dashboard/central \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq
```
✅ **Expected**: JSON with totalProjects, totalBudget, utilizationRate, avgProgress, slaBreaches, stateWiseData, componentWiseData

### AC3: State Dashboard Allows Progress Updates
```bash
# Login as state officer
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"officer@mh.gov.in","password":"state123"}' \
  | jq -r '.token')

# Update progress
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/v1/projects/1/progress \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"progress_percent":65,"note":"Updated via test"}'

# Verify update reflected
curl http://localhost:5000/api/v1/projects/1 | jq '.progress_percent'
```
✅ **Expected**: Progress updates successfully and reflects in subsequent GET requests

### AC4: Public Dashboard Shows Interactive Map
1. Visit: http://localhost:3000/dashboard/public
2. Verify: Map displays with project markers
3. Click: Any marker to see popup
4. Test: Search and filter functionality
5. Click: Project card to see detail modal

✅ **Expected**: Fully interactive map with 4 sample projects, searchable and filterable

### AC5: Code Committed to Feature Branch
```bash
git branch
```
✅ **Expected**: Shows `feature/three-dashboards` branch

### AC6: README with Run Steps
✅ **Completed**: README.md has complete installation and run instructions

## Architecture Decisions

### Why SQLite?
- No external database server required
- Perfect for free tier hosting (Volt/Volt AI)
- Production-ready for 10k-100k records
- Zero configuration needed
- Easy migration path to PostgreSQL/MySQL

### Why OpenStreetMap?
- Completely free (no API keys)
- No usage limits or quotas
- Open-source with active community
- Excellent coverage for India
- Leaflet library is lightweight and mature

### Why JWT?
- Stateless authentication (scalable)
- No server-side session storage needed
- Industry standard
- Easy to implement and verify
- Works well with React context

### Why Local File Storage?
- No external services needed
- Compatible with free hosting tiers
- Simple implementation with Multer
- Can easily migrate to S3/CloudStorage later

---

## Technical Highlights

### SLA Breach Calculation
```sql
SELECT
  (julianday('now') - julianday(start_date)) * 100.0 /
  (julianday(end_date) - julianday(start_date)) as expected_progress,
  progress_percent,
  id, title
FROM projects
WHERE status = 'ongoing'
```
Breach = `progress_percent < (expected_progress - 10%)`

### Fund Flow Tracking
Three-stage tracking:
1. **Allocated**: Budget sanctioned for project
2. **Released**: Funds transferred to executing agency
3. **Utilized**: Actual expenditure recorded

### Real-time Progress Updates
State officers can update progress with:
- Progress percentage (0-100)
- Optional notes
- Automatic audit log entry
- Instant reflection in central dashboard
